In this post\nI try to give an answer by calculating the website similarities between the Wikipedia pages of Batman, the Joker and\nRobin. Some web scraping, data wrangling and NLP with Python lies ahead!",

    "description": "Our intuition and experience in low dimensions tells us that random standard normal vectors cluster around the origin.\nIn higher dimensions, this is no longer true. Instead, despite having expectation zero, n-dimensional vectors with \nindependent N(0,1) entries will concentrate tightly around a sphere of radius n^0.5. \nIn particular, they will be nowhere near the origin. In this post we look at the mathematical theory behind why\nthat is.",
